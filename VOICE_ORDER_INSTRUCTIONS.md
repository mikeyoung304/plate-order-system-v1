# Voice Order System - Fixed Instructions

The voice order system has been fixed and should now be working properly. Here's what was done:

1. Fixed CORS_ORIGINS format in backend .env file
2. Added test mode fallback for DeepgramService when API key is missing
3. Fixed permission handling logic in the voice-order-panel.tsx component
4. Added debug WebSocket endpoint for easier troubleshooting

## Testing the Voice Order System

1. Access the application at: http://localhost:3000/server or whatever page has the voice order panel
2. Click the microphone button to enable microphone access when prompted
3. After allowing microphone access, the button should change to "Hold to Record"
4. Press and hold the button to record your order
5. Release the button to stop recording
6. Review the transcription and click "Confirm Order" if correct
7. If there are any issues, click "Cancel" and try again

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Make sure both servers are running (backend on port 8000, frontend on port 3000)
2. Check the browser console for any error messages
3. Refresh the page to get the latest code changes
4. Try using the test script: `python test_websocket.py` to verify connections work
5. If the Deepgram API isn't working, the system now falls back to test mode automatically

## Technical Details

The main issues were:
- Improper CORS format in environment variables
- Permission state not being reset properly after granting microphone access
- WebSocket connections not being managed correctly during permission changes

These issues have been fixed, and the system should now work smoothly.
