3. ✅ implement_floor_plan_component
4. ✅ implement_voice_recorder_component
5. ✅ implement_server_view_js
6. ✅ implement_microinteractions
7. ✅ test_server_view

## Implementation Details

### Server View Template

We created a responsive server view template (`app/templates/server-view.html`) that:
- Extends the base template created in Module 1
- Implements a fixed-width layout optimized for iPad (1024px)
- Includes sections for the floor plan and order management
- Incorporates a voice recorder modal for taking orders by voice

The template is structured with a grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, with special consideration for the iPad's dimensions.

### Server View CSS

We implemented custom CSS styles (`app/static/css/server-view.css`) that:
- Define the layout and appearance of the server view
- Style the floor plan and tables with different states (available, occupied, reserved)
- Provide styling for the voice recorder modal
- Include responsive design adjustments for different screen sizes

### Floor Plan Component

We implemented a JavaScript floor plan component that:
- Loads and renders tables from the API
- Allows table selection and displays order information
- Implements zoom controls for the floor plan
- Handles table status updates

The floor plan component is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, with clear visual indicators for table status.

### Voice Recorder Component

We implemented a voice recorder component that:
- Captures audio input from the device microphone
- Sends the audio to the API for transcription
- Displays the transcription result
- Allows adding the transcribed order to the current order

This component leverages the browser's MediaRecorder API and integrates with the speech API endpoint.

### Server View JavaScript

We implemented the main JavaScript file (`app/static/js/server-view.js`) that:
- Initializes and coordinates the floor plan and voice recorder components
- Handles user interactions and updates the UI accordingly
- Manages the order section and its interactions with the selected table
- Implements utility functions for formatting and data processing

### Microinteractions

We added various microinteractions to enhance the user experience:
- Button hover and active states with subtle animations
- Table selection effects with visual feedback
- Modal transitions for smooth opening and closing
- Order item animations when added or updated
- Touch feedback optimized for iPad and other touch devices

These microinteractions make the interface more engaging and provide important visual feedback to users.

### Testing

We created a comprehensive test script that:
- Verifies that all required files exist
- Tests the server view in a browser using Puppeteer
- Checks interactions with the floor plan and voice recorder
- Tests responsive design at different screen sizes
- Captures screenshots for visual verification

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Floor Plan**
   - Visual representation of tables with status indicators
   - Table selection with order management
   - Zoom controls for better visibility

2. **Voice Order System**
   - Voice recording capability
   - Integration with speech-to-text API
   - Transcription display and processing

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Optimized for iPad (1024px width)
   - Adapts to different screen orientations
   - Touch-friendly interface elements

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Table status updates based on order status
   - Order management with real-time feedback

5. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Visual feedback for user actions
   - Intuitive interface for servers

## Next Steps

With Module 2 complete, we're ready to move on to Module 3: Kitchen View UI/UX for iPad. This module will focus on:

1. Creating the kitchen display system (KDS) interface
2. Implementing order cards with status indicators
3. Adding order filtering and sorting functionality
4. Implementing real-time updates via WebSockets

The foundation we've built in Modules 1 and 2 will be essential for implementing these features in Module 3.

## Running the Server View

To see the server view in action:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the server view in a browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/server-view
   ```

3. Interact with the floor plan by clicking on tables
4. Test the voice order functionality by clicking the "Voice Order" button

## Technical Notes

- The server view is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- It integrates with the existing API endpoints for floor plan and orders
- The voice recorder uses the MediaRecorder API, which requires HTTPS in production
- The implementation follows best practices for responsive design and touch interfaces
