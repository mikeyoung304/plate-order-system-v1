// Expo-specific workflow:

// 1. Use Expo's Git integration
// Many Expo environments allow pushing to Git repositories

// 2. Use Expo's export functionality
// Export your project to download as a zip file

// 3. Use Expo CLI locally
// Assuming 'expo', 'web', 'your', and 'project' are meant to be placeholders or are available in the environment.
// If they are variables, they need to be declared or imported.
// For example, if 'expo' is a command-line tool, ensure it's installed and in your PATH.
// If 'web', 'your', and 'project' are variables, you might need to define them like this:
// const web = "web"; // Or get it from a configuration file or environment variable
// const your = "your";
// const project = "project";

// If the intention is to use the expo-cli command directly, the following line should work if expo-cli is installed globally.
// If it's a local dependency, you might need to adjust the command accordingly (e.g., using npx).

// Example assuming 'your-expo-project' is a literal string:\
expo
pull: web
your - expo - project
// This pulls your web project configuration
