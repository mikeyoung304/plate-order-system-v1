# Module 1 Implementation: Project Structure and Foundation

This README provides instructions for running the Module 1 implementation script, which sets up the foundation for the Plate Order System overhaul.

## What the Script Does

The `implement-module1.sh` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Cleans up duplicate directory structure**
   - Removes the nested plate-order-system directory

2. **Sets up Tailwind CSS**
   - Installs Tailwind CSS and its dependencies
   - Creates a custom tailwind.config.js with project-specific theme settings
   - Sets up a base CSS file with custom component classes

3. **Creates modular file structure for frontend components**
   - Establishes directories for components, utilities, and services
   - Creates base component files and organization
   - Sets up utility functions for API calls, date formatting, etc.

4. **Establishes API router organization**
   - Creates a central router file
   - Sets up separate router files for different API endpoints
   - Updates main.py to use the new router structure

5. **Creates basic template files**
   - Sets up server view, kitchen view, and admin view templates
   - Configures them to use the new CSS framework

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. Node.js and npm installed
3. Git installed (optional, for version control)

## Running the Script

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x implement-module1.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./implement-module1.sh
   ```

3. The script will run automatically and implement all the changes. It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

## After Running the Script

Once the script completes:

1. You can start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser:
   - Server View: http://localhost:8000/server
   - Kitchen View: http://localhost:8000/kitchen
   - Admin View: http://localhost:8000/admin

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the terminal output for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies were installed correctly
3. Verify that the script had the necessary permissions to modify files

## Next Steps

After successfully implementing Module 1, you can proceed to Module 2 (Server View UI/UX for iPad) implementation.
