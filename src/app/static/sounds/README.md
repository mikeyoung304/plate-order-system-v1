# Sound Files for Kitchen Display System

This directory contains sound files used by the Kitchen Display System (KDS) for audio notifications.

## Sound Files

- `start.mp3`: Played when an order is started (moved to "In Progress")
- `ready.mp3`: Played when an order is marked as "Ready"
- `complete.mp3`: Played when an order is completed
- `alert.mp3`: Played when an order is flagged
- `notification.mp3`: General notification sound

## Note

These are placeholder files. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual MP3 files.

To add your own sound files:
1. Create MP3 files with the names listed above
2. Place them in this directory
3. Make sure they are short (1-2 seconds) to avoid disrupting the kitchen workflow
