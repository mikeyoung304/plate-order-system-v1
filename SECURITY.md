# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Plate Order System team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security@example.com with details about the vulnerability
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested remediation or mitigation steps

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 business days with our evaluation and planned next steps.

## Security Update Process

1. Security issues are prioritized based on severity and potential impact
2. Critical vulnerabilities will receive hotfixes as soon as possible
3. Security patches for non-critical issues will be bundled with regular releases
4. We maintain a security changelog that documents resolved security issues

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions

1. **Never commit credentials or secrets** to the repository
2. Follow the environment variable management process described in [SECURE-CREDENTIALS-GUIDE.md](SECURE-CREDENTIALS-GUIDE.md)
3. Use secure coding practices:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Escape output to prevent XSS
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details
4. Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities

### Environment Setup and Credentials Management

1. Use `.env.example` as a template and create your own `.env` file locally
2. Store actual credentials in `.env.secure` (not committed to version control)
3. Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up permissions
4. Rotate API keys and credentials regularly
5. For production deployments, use environment variables or secrets management services provided by your hosting platform

### Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to enforce security practices:

1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Set up the hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. The hooks will run automatically before each commit

Pre-commit checks include:
- Detecting private keys
- Finding and preventing secrets from being committed
- Security scanning for Python dependencies
- Code linting and formatting

### Database Security

1. Follow the principle of least privilege for database access
2. Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
3. For Supabase, properly configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. Ensure query performance is optimized to prevent DoS vulnerabilities

### API Security

1. Use proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Validate request parameters thoroughly
4. Set appropriate CORS headers for frontend integration

### Frontend Security

1. Guard against XSS attacks by sanitizing user input
2. Implement CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
3. Use secure cookies with appropriate flags
4. Follow frontend security best practices for your framework (React, Next.js, etc.)

## Supported Versions

Only the latest major version of Plate Order System receives security updates. Users are encouraged to stay updated with the latest releases.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest | :x:               |

## Security Tools and Resources

The project uses several security tools:

1. **detect-secrets**: Prevents secret leakage in code
2. **safety**: Checks Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
3. **eslint**: Enforces secure JavaScript/TypeScript coding patterns
4. **pre-commit hooks**: Automates security checks before code is committed
