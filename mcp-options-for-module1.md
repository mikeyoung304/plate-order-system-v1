# MCP Options for Module 1 Remaining Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines potential Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that could enhance our development workflow for the remaining tasks in Module 1 of the Plate Order System project:

1. `build_css`
2. `create_base_templates`

## 1. CSS Processing MCP Server

### Purpose
To automate and optimize the CSS build process, particularly for Tailwind CSS integration.

### Tools Provided

1. **build_tailwind_css**
   - Builds Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
   - Handles minification and purging of unused CSS
   - Generates production-ready CSS files

2. **create_postcss_config**
   - Creates a PostCSS configuration file with specified plugins
   - Configures the build process for optimal results

3. **analyze_css**
   - Analyzes CSS files for size and complexity
   - Identifies potential optimization opportunities

### Benefits for `build_css` Task

- Automates the CSS build process with best practices
- Ensures consistent output across development environments
- Optimizes CSS for production with minification and purging
- Provides insights into CSS file size and complexity

## 2. Template Generation MCP Server

### Purpose
To streamline the creation of HTML templates and components with consistent structure and styling.

### Tools Provided

1. **create_base_template**
   - Creates a base HTML template with proper structure
   - Includes configurable options for navbar, footer, and sidebar
   - Sets up template inheritance blocks
   - Implements responsive design principles

2. **create_component_template**
   - Generates reusable UI components (cards, buttons, forms, etc.)
   - Creates consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
   - Includes optional JavaScript functionality

3. **create_page_template**
   - Creates page templates that extend the base template
   - Sets up proper block inheritance
   - Includes components as needed

### Benefits for `create_base_templates` Task

- Ensures consistent template structure across the application
- Implements best practices for template inheritance
- Creates reusable components for different views
- Reduces development time and potential for errors

## Implementation Approach

1. **For CSS Processing**:
   - Create an MCP server that interfaces with PostCSS and Tailwind
   - Set up tools for building, analyzing, and optimizing CSS
   - Configure for the specific needs of the Plate Order System

2. **For Template Generation**:
   - Create an MCP server that generates HTML templates
   - Implement tools for creating base templates, components, and pages
   - Ensure templates follow best practices for structure and responsiveness

## Next Steps

1. Create the CSS Processing MCP server to support the `build_css` task
2. Create the Template Generation MCP server to support the `create_base_templates` task
3. Integrate these MCP servers into our development workflow
4. Use the provided tools to implement the remaining tasks in Module 1

These MCP servers will provide a solid foundation for the remaining tasks in Module 1 and set us up for success in the subsequent modules.
